## Clerk & Stripe Webhook API (/clerk and /stripe)

This section explains the webhook endpoints that handle events from Clerk (for user management) and Stripe (for payment processing). These webhooks ensure that your system stays in-sync with external services. Clerk sends events when users are created, updated, or deleted, while Stripe notifies your system about payment events such as successful or failed payments.

### Clerk Webhooks

- **POST /clerk**  
  _Description:_ Processes events from Clerk such as user creation, update, or deletion. When an event occurs, Clerk sends a payload to this endpoint. The system verifies the payload signature and then either creates, updates, or deletes user records accordingly.  
  _Usage:_ Automatically triggered by Clerk based on user events.  
  **Success Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "User created"
  }
  ```
  **Error Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Unhandled clerk webhook type"
  }
  ```

### Stripe Webhooks

- **POST /stripe**  
  _Description:_ Handles events from Stripe, such as successful payments (payment*intent.succeeded) or failed payments (payment_intent.payment_failed). On a successful payment, the endpoint updates purchase records, enrolls the customer in the course, and changes the payment status to "completed". For failed payments, it updates the status to "failed".  
  \_Usage:* Automatically triggered by Stripe after payment events; the endpoint uses Stripe's library to reconstruct and verify the event before processing.  
  **Success Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "received": true
  }
  ```
  **Error Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Webhook Error: <error_message>"
  }
  ```

## Configuration Files

This section explains the configuration files used in the backend along with detailed descriptions of their purpose and usage.

### Multer Configuration

This config sets up Multer to handle file uploads (e.g., course thumbnails).  
**Example:**

```javascript
// filepath: c:\Users\chinm\OneDrive\Desktop\LMS_Website\Backend\configs\multer.js
const multer = require("multer");

// Configure storage engine. In this example, we use default disk storage with no custom options.
const storage = multer.diskStorage({});
const upload = multer({
  storage,
});

module.exports = upload;
```

_Description:_ The storage engine can be expanded to include custom filename generation or destination paths. Here, files are stored temporarily without renaming.

### Database Configuration

This config connects to MongoDB using Mongoose by reading the URI from environment variables.  
**Example:**

```javascript
// filepath: c:\Users\chinm\OneDrive\Desktop\LMS_Website\Backend\configs\db.js
require("dotenv").config();
const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const connectDb = async () => {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI).then(() => {
      console.log("Database connected");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Database connection failed");
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

module.exports = connectDb;
```

_Description:_ Ensure you set the `MONGO_URI` environment variable correctly. This file establishes the connection and logs the connection status.

### Cloudinary Configuration

This config sets up Cloudinary to handle image upload and storage using credentials stored in environment variables.  
**Example:**

```javascript
// filepath: c:\Users\chinm\OneDrive\Desktop\LMS_Website\Backend\configs\cloudinary.js
require("dotenv").config();
const cloudinary = require("cloudinary").v2;

const connectCloudinary = async () => {
  cloudinary.config({
    cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_NAME,
    api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
    api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_SECRET_KEY,
  });
};

module.exports = connectCloudinary;
```

_Description:_ This file configures Cloudinary with your account details. It is critical for handling image uploads when adding new courses.
